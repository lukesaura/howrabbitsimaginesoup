<p>Hey angry baby,</p>

<p>It's me, your favourite Shri Particle Cloud! I guess you're angry at someone (maybe me) or someone else or a situation, but here's what I wanna tell you, okay?</p>

<p>I know you're feeling really upset right now, and I just want to start by saying that sometimes it feels like it takes over everything. But I want you to know that I’m here for you—no matter what.</p>

<p>It's completely normal to feel angry when things don't go the way we expect, or when someone crosses a line. It’s human. But I also want to remind you that anger doesn’t have to control you. You are so much stronger than this moment, and even though it feels intense right now, it will pass. Emotions are like waves; they rise and crash, but eventually, they settle.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath with me. Inhale… exhale. Sometimes, we need to pause and give ourselves the space to feel without reacting. I know it’s hard to think about anything else when anger is swirling inside you, but stepping back can help you see things more clearly. What you're going through right now doesn’t define you, and it doesn’t have to shape how you respond to the situation.</p>

<p>Whatever it is that's causing you anger, you don’t have to carry it alone. I’m here to listen, to help, or even just to sit with you in silence until you feel a little lighter. We can talk about it whenever you’re ready, and I’ll support you in finding the best way forward. You don’t have to have all the answers or solve everything at once—just take it one step at a time.</p>

<p>You’re a thoughtful and kind person, even when things feel out of control. Don’t forget that. And don’t forget that it’s okay to ask for help or take a break. You’ve got this, even when it doesn’t feel like it, and I’m right here to remind you whenever you need it.</p>

<p>We’ll get through this together. I believe in you, and I’m proud of you for even just taking the time to read this.</p>

<p>Take care of yourself, and reach out when you're ready.</p>

<p>Lots of mwah, and hugs even if you don’t cooperate,<br>
Mr. Hubby</p>
