<p>Heyyyy baby gurrlllll,</p>

<p>It's me, your favourite Shri Particle Cloud!</p>

<p>I know the bad dream must be terrifying, mannn. En ammukuttiye, En chellamey, En thangakattiye, En kutty poona kuttyiye, En vairu kaasey, Ennoda ellamey nee tha. Nee tha sonna, whatever happens in the dreams, doesn't ever happen in real life. SO rest easy, okay?</p>

<p>I know nothing can really replace the feeling of me holding you and rocking you back to sleep, but hopefully, this compensates for that. I love you so much, and I hope I could save you from everything in this world. If you just had a nightmare and you aren't able to sleep, go to your kitchen, grab some water, just read through the thing I wrote for sleeping, and try that out, okay?</p>

<p>The root of all nightmares is something that's been running in the back of your mind. So, it's a sign that you've been worrying about it a lot. That's all—it’s nothing meaningful or anything, so rest easy. Anything can be solved with good sleep and food and (me... ahem). Go back to sleep, my baby &lt;3</p>

<p>Your sleep drug,<br>
Shrinii</p>
