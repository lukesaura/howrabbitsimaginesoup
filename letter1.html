<p>Hey baby,</p>

<p>It's me, your favourite Shri Particle Cloud!</p>

<p>How are you? Not so good I believe, since you're here. So you're here 'cause you miss me right? Maybe because we haven't talked in a while because of unforeseen circumstances. Unless it's unavoidable, I don't think you being here is possible. If you're still here, I'm sorry for being an irresponsible boyfriend ON his behalf. Chi, I'll make sure to give him a good beating once he's here.</p>

<p>I know that right now, the distance between us feels overwhelming. It's hard to be apart, and he's missing you just as much as you're missing him—probably even more. But even though we're not physically together, I want you to know that you're never far from my thoughts.</p>

<p>Every moment we're apart only reminds me of how lucky I am to have you in my life. I carry the sound of your laughter, the warmth of your hugs, and the way you look at me—deep in my heart. I think about all the little things we share, from our silly laughtales to our quiet moments, and it makes me smile even when the distance feels tough.</p>

<p>I know this time apart isn’t easy, but it’s temporary. Soon enough, we’ll be together again, and all of these days apart will make our reunion even more special. Until then, I want you to focus on all the wonderful things we’ve built together. Our connection, our love, is stronger than anything that could keep us apart.</p>

<p>Whenever you miss me, just close your eyes and imagine me holding you tight, whispering that everything will be alright. I’m here with you, always, in spirit and in love. And no matter how far away I may be physically, my heart is always right there with you, and that's what I always mean when I say, if you look hard enough, I'm always around you, whispering to you through the wind that carries my voice all the way from where I am, to you. That's one of the reasons I love the wind; it hears everything!</p>

<p>I’m counting down the days until I can hold you again, and we’ll pick up right where we left off. Until then, remember that I love you deeply, and I'm just a call or message away whenever you need me.</p>

<p>Stay strong, my love. We’ll get through this together.</p>

<p>With all my love and mwahs,<br>
Hubby shrinikheathan</p>
