<p>Heyyyy baby gurrlllll,</p>

<p>It's me, your favourite Shri Particle Cloud!</p>

<p>And yeah, first off, whatever I did, idc, I apologize. Did I cheat on you in your dream? I'm sorry. Did I say I wouldn't love you if you were a worm? I'm sorry. Did I say you look better than Samantha Prabhu?? OMG I'm soooo sorry, ong.</p>

<p>If I did something worse?? Ohhh god, save ME! (from you)</p>

<p>But for real, if I ended up hurting you, I really apologize. Please give me a chance to explain, okay?</p>

<p>It's fine if you don't come to me immediately, just come back soon, that's all.</p>

<p>I'll be waiting for you, my love, please come back.</p>

<p>Shrini</p>
