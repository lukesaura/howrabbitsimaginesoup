<p>Heyyyy baby gurrllll,</p>

<p>It's me, your favourite Shri Particle Cloud! And, like Po from *Kung Fu Panda*, the next scariest thing for you after lizards is not being able to sleep. Achu paapssuuuu, ahdoisfciore, I’m sooo sorry I’m not there to put you to sleep.</p>

<p>I know you already make up scenarios to help you fall asleep, but here’s what I’d do to get you to sleep. Assuming you're reading this at home, I’ll suggest you set your room up first to your liking—closed curtains, AC on full blast, all that. Put your phone down, listen to some songs, set a sleep timer, and then put your phone away, okay?</p>

<p>Cuddle with your pillow and try to sleep. If that still doesn’t work, read a book, baby! Books are way better than Instagram and YouTube. <3</p>

<p>If you feel like, “Wow, I really can’t sleep at all,” and if there’s red wine, drink some of that or just walk around your home, stare at the lovely moon, and just imagine eating the moon. Try it.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Did you try it yet?</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>HAHA LOL I MADE YOU LOOK STUPIDDDD!!</p>

<p>I bet the moon tastes yummy though? But yes, these should help you, baby. Think of my chest and arms, and go have sweet dreams.</p>

<p>Lots of smooches and forehead kisses,<br>
Shrini</p>
