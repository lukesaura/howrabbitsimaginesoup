    <h1>OPEN WHEN .. you're doubtful</h1>

    <div class="letter-content">
        <p>Hey beautiful baby,</p>

<p>It's me, your favourite Shri Particle Cloud!</p>

<p>It's weird that you're here, 'cuz the last time I heard about your whereabouts, you were popular in Coolville!? I searched your name on findbeautifulgirls.com, and you showed up first?!? I heard girls feel jealous of you 'cause you're both beauty and smartness?? I heard your sass can make a guy cry and beg?? I heard your walk and the firm strong voice that you have would bring great walls crumbling?? I don't really get why you're really here, but I think there could be a few situations here:</p>

<ol>
    <li>If you feel less beautiful</li>
    <li>If you feel hard about taking a decision</li>
    <li>If you doubt our future (impossible)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>First option:</strong></p>

<p>If you're feeling any less beautiful, I'll include some photos down here, and you could decide for yourself who's the queen. I have heard that beauty transcends time, and anything that's beautiful is not really subjective but universal. Whenever I see you, this song plays for me:</p>

<p>ஓ ஹோ மின் வெட்டு நாளில் இங்கே<br>
மின்சாரம் போல வந்தாயே<br>
வா வா என் வெளிச்ச பூவே வா<br>
ஓ ஹோ மின் வெட்டு நாளில் இங்கே<br>
மின்சாரம் போல வந்தாயே<br>
வா வா என் வெளிச்ச பூவே வா<br>
உயிர் தீட்டும் உயிலே வா<br>
குளிர் நீக்கும் வெயிலே வா<br>
அழைதேன் வா அன்பே<br>
மழை மேகம் வரும் போதே<br>
மயில் தோகை விரியாதோ<br>
அழைத்தேன் வா அன்பே<br>
காதல் காதல் ஒரு ஜொரம்<br>
காலம் யாவும் அது வரும்<br>
ஆதாம், ஏவால் தொடங்கிய கலை<br>
தொடர் கதை அடங்கியதில்லையே</p>

<p>Not only are you the most beautiful in my eyes, even the blind could see your blinding beauty. If I was blind and I got my vision back, I would have no regrets losing my sight after being blinded by your beauty. Your voice is most soothing, your skin is most supple and smooth, your hair is most beautiful and it flows like the Kuttralam falls. Your lips are red and remind me of an apple, your nose is like a parrot's—cute and so distinctive, and your eyes are like watching a movie, so good, so breathtaking, you would never want to leave the theater.</p>

<p>Don't ever be influenced by others' opinions, as people would choose you if they weren't so blinded by materialistic objects in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Second option:</strong></p>

<p>So, if you feel hard about making a decision, make sure you take enough sugar and set your mind free! Take a walk, most preferably stare at the vast skies, and feel the fresh air entering your lungs and leave you rejuvenated. Think hard and however it is, don't let the situation force you into making a wrong decision. No matter who says what, do it 'cause you feel like doing it, not because you're made to. If you do feel like you're backed into a decision, for God's sake, involve someone in it.</p>

<p><strong>Third option:</strong></p>

<p>Impossible. Stop thinking about it.</p>
