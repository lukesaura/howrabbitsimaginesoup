    <h1>OPEN WHEN .. you're frustrated</h1>

    <div class="letter-content">
        <p><p>Hey baby,</p>

<p>It's me, your favourite Shri Particle Cloud! By the looks of it, guess you're feeling frustrated lately, and I just want to say that I’m here for you. Sometimes things don’t go the way we want them to, no matter how hard we try or how much effort we put in—and I know how tough that can be.</p>

<p>It’s okay to feel frustrated. Life throws challenges our way, and it can feel overwhelming when it seems like nothing is going as planned. But please remember that you don’t have to face it all on your own. I’m right here, ready to listen, help, or just be by your side. And even if I'm not here right now, you have come a long way, babe, and I know you get what you want, in the most rishi-way possible.</p>

<p>Just step back for a moment. Take a deep breath. You’ve handled difficult situations before, and you’ve come out stronger every time. This moment of frustration doesn’t define you—it’s just a temporary feeling. And even though it’s frustrating right now, you will get through this. You’re more resilient than you give yourself credit for, and I believe in you. Not just me, tbh. Your family, your friends, me, even Mr. Murugan!</p>

<p>If things aren’t going your way today, that doesn’t mean they won’t get better tomorrow or in the days ahead. Frustration is just a sign that you care, that you’re passionate about what you’re doing, and that you want the best. And that’s something to be proud of.</p>

<p>I know you’ll find your way through this, no matter how hard it feels right now. And whenever you’re ready, we can talk about what’s going on, or we can just hang out and take your mind off things for a bit. Sometimes a little break can work wonders.</p>

<p>No matter what, I’m here with you every step of the way. You don’t have to carry this alone. Things will get better, and you’ll come out even stronger on the other side.</p>

<p>Mr. Hubby, your Batman,<br>
Frustratingly too deep in love with your pretty ass,<br>
Shrinikheathan</p>
